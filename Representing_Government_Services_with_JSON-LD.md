## Overview

The civic services schema.org proposal is a proposed standard for representing government services targeted to indvidiuals and businesses. Schema.org is a set of schema standards that web masters use to provide machine readable information about data in a HTML document.

However, schema.org is not limited to HTML, and other representation formats exist. One of these, JSON for Linking Data, is a lightweight representation of schema.org entities, that is valid JSON with a minimal amount of schema specific data.

For more information about schema.org see their Getting Started guide.

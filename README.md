Documenting Government Services 
==============

## Overview


## Why Do This?

Every government agency offers the public a variety of services, some general and others specific to certain constituencies.  There's tremendous potential in making public discovery easier, thus helping more of those who these services are meant to help.  

Though agency websites may contain information about these services on their websites, this information often cannot be consumed and disseminated further by third parties in a machine-readible way.  By generating small, discrete machine-readable files that describe these services, an agency can empower these third parties, such as Internet search engines, to provide quicker, easier discovery to the public.
